A function to plot double mutualistic interactions in a simple and comprehensive manner.
Double mutualists (e.g. birds) will be plotted in the middle, and their interactions
will be plotted below and above similarly to the plotweb() function. 

To include more detail, we plot abundance of the double mutualists based on their observed 
numbers (e.g. number of caught individuals) and we plot their interactions based on percentages.
For instance, if only 10% of the individuals participated in one of the ecosystem functions,
but 50% participated in the other function, this will be very easy to see.
